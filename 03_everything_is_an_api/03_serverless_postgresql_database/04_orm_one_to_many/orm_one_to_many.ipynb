    "A one-to-many relationship in an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like SQLAlchemy describes a common database pattern where a single record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table.

    "In a one-to-many relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **\"One\" side (Parent):** This entity holds the primary key.\n",
    "  * **\"Many\" side (Child):** This entity holds a **foreign key** that references the primary key of the \"one\" side.\n",

    "  * A `Department` can have many `Employee`s.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation of Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`ForeignKey('departments.id')`**: This is defined on the `Employee` model (`department_id` column). It tells SQLAlchemy that this column refers to the `id` column of the `departments` table. This is the **crucial part for the database relationship**.\n",
    "  * **`relationship('Employee', back_populates='department')`** (on `Department`):\n",
    "      * `'Employee'` refers to the Python class name of the related model.\n",
    "      * `back_populates='department'` tells SQLAlchemy that there's a corresponding `relationship()` on the `Employee` model named `department` that points back to `Department`. This creates a **bidirectional relationship**, allowing you to navigate from `Department` to `Employee`s (`department.employees`) and from an `Employee` to their `Department` (`employee.department`).\n",
    "  * **`relationship('Department', back_populates='employees')`** (on `Employee`):\n",
