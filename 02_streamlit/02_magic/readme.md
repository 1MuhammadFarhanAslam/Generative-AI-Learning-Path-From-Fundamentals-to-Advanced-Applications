### ü™Ñ What is **Streamlit Magic**?

**Streamlit Magic** refers to a **convenience feature** in Streamlit that automatically renders certain objects (like DataFrames, strings, numbers, plots, etc.) **without explicitly using `st.write()` or other `st.*` functions**.


### Example of Streamlit Magic

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "Age": [25, 30, 35]
})

df  # ‚Üê This line uses Streamlit Magic to render the DataFrame
```

You **don‚Äôt** have to write `st.write(df)` ‚Äî Streamlit detects that `df` is the last expression and renders it automatically.

### üîé When Does Magic Work?

Magic works when:

* An object is the last statement in a code block or script section.
* It's a "displayable" object: strings, numbers, DataFrames, plots (e.g., Matplotlib, Altair), etc.

```python
"Hello World!"  # Displays the string

1234  # Displays the number

# Same as:
st.write("Hello World!")
st.write(1234)
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* Magic **only works at the top level** of a script, not inside functions or loops.
* It only applies to **standalone expressions**, not assignments or side-effects.

```python
x = "Hello"   # This won‚Äôt be displayed unless you do st.write(x)
```

---

### ü§î Should You Use It?

‚úÖ **Good for quick prototyping**, notebooks, demos
‚ö†Ô∏è **Use `st.write()` in production** for clarity and consistency.

### üìå Summary

| Expression Type     | With Magic | Without Magic       |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| `"Hello"`           | Yes        | `st.write("Hello")` |
| `df`                | Yes        | `st.write(df)`      |
| `matplotlib.pyplot` | Yes        | `st.pyplot(fig)`    |
| `x = "Hello"`       | ‚ùå No       | `st.write(x)`       |

# Magic

Magic commands are a feature in Streamlit that allows you to write almost anything (markdown, data, charts) without having to type an explicit command at all. Just put the thing you want to show on its own line of code, and it will appear in your app.
